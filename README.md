I switched from manually editing my local hosts file to using [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). Pi-hole is a [DNS sinkhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) that runs on local hardware (for example a Raspberry-Pi or an old laptop). The advantage is that it can block ads and tracking for all other devices in your local network. Exactly, that means smartphones too!

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) offers cool stats, a one click "block this domain" functionality and general peace of mind as it has a big list of denied trackers. Combined with a browser like [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) it makes the modern web less annoying.

## Why should I do this?
I recommend reading ["The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26195941-the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) by Soshana Zuboff. It's an accurate description of what is happening: we are tracked online and offline to be sold as "data" to create personalized advertisement to modify our behavior.  
I am not against online ads per se, but the privacy invasion is huge. I like my privacy.

An easier-to-digest alternative is ["The Great Hack"](https://www.netflix.com/title/80117542) on Netflix about the scandal of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook.
